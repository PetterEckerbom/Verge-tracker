This is a Simple app I built to test what you can use public APIs for, it thought me a lot but is unfortunatly pretty useless as far superior apps are already on the market such as the mobile app [Delta](https://getdelta.io)

### Try it!
If you want to try it cou can download it and run with the command
```sh
Node app
```
It will run on port 5000 by default so it can be accessed through the browser with
```sh
127.0.0.1:5000 or localhost:5000
```
Make sure to have nodejs installed
